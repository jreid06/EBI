                            <p class="text-center">If you're like most people, you don't really ask that much from your investments: You want a solid return on your money, and you're not interested in "betting the farm" in order to get it. But most people have such limited investment choices: They can invest in a money-market fund or a CD, and get a return that usually doesn't even keep up with inflation.
                                <br>
                                <br> Or they can gamble in the stock market: There, every day is another roller-coaster trip, filled with accounting scandals, oil price fears, and just plain old greed. Some choice that is! Whatever happened to decent risk and solid returns?</p>

                            <p class="text-center">Well, there IS a better way, and the people that know about this great investment alternative are more than happy to keep it "hush-hush", out of the newspapers. So what's the better way? It's...</p>
                            <p class="text-center"><strong>…Investing in real estate as a secured lender.</strong></p>
                            <p class="text-center">In a nutshell, what this means is you get an excellent interest rate on your money, secured by a specific piece of property. If things go well, you get your money back, on top of a very attractive interest rate. If for some reason the borrower runs into difficulty, your investment is more than covered by the value of that property.</p>

                        <p class="text-center">It's simple: Because they don't make their fat commissions from these types of investments, so they don't want people to know they exist. They want to put blinders on you, and have you focus on just the types of investments that make THEM the most money…not the ones that make YOU the most money.</p>
                        <p class="text-center">This website is full of information on investments that can potentially earn you a solid return, WITH safety. Who are we, and how do we know about these investments? We're real estate professionals. Not real estate agents, who simply list homes that people want to buy and sell. Instead, we're real estate problem solvers.
                            <br>
                            <br> We are constantly in the local real estate market as investors ourselves: finding houses that people must sell quickly…finding ways to get hard-working families out of the "rental rat race" and into a home, even if they have credit problems, etc.
                            <br>
                            <br> To be honest, we find more good real estate opportunities than even we can invest in at any one time. That's why we use a large network of banks, mortgage companies and investors to participate along with us.
                            <br>
                            <br> We invite you to see what you've been missing. Please browse this site and see for yourself the excellent investment opportunities that the "pillars of your community" have known about for years, but cannot keep to themselves any longer.</p>
